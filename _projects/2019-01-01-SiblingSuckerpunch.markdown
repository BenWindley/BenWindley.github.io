### Concept

This was our submission for the 2019 Global Game Jam, in which we created a fun 2.5D brawler where you fight with your brother, each of them feature their own special move and taunt.

We ended up winning the game jam with this submission by community vote and it was an incredible moment to create a game I'm proud of be well recieved. As this had been my 4th GGJ and roughly my 6th facilitated jam, our team had the focus of fun and a decent night's sleep (of which we had plenty of both).
