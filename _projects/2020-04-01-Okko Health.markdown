### Responsibilities
Over the two months I collaborated with researchers to design, create, and playtest minigames in an iterrative environment, with many of the minigames being added to the final product and showing medically corrolating results.

Developed shaders in HLSL to accurately reproduce medical eye-tests digitally.

The second time I joined the team I helped polish the app for release.
