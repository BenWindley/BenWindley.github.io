## Concept Analysis

The initial idea for Chess-com centered around what is possible in via networking:
- Limiting what each player can see separately.
- Allow for anyone to play each other.

The inspiration originated from a new game 'Into the Breach' which had a feeling of chess in it's tactical nature, however it deviated from chess in how it allowed all pieces to have movement.

By expanding from 'Into the Breach' going further towards chess by adopting the pieces and balanced nature of the game, but adopting the team mechanic alters the experience towards meta-tactics as well as the in-game tactics.
