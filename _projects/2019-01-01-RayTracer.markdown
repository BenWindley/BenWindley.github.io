### Concept
I was tasked to create a ray tracer to generate images including a Bounding Volume Hierachy (BVH) accelaration structure. The project was then split into the following features:

- Sphere-Ray Intersection
- Triangle-Ray Intersection
- Ray Reflection
- BVH Accelaration
- Multi-Threaded
- Texturing

This was carried out through the use of SFML to draw individual pixels.

My favourite part of this project was the ability to see the accelaration structures drastically shortening the time per render. However, in the future I would like to add features such as refraction and global illumination.
