### Concept
This game used the Oculus Quest to feature multiplayer co-op gameplay in a wild-west themed minecart action-puzzle adventure game!

In this game I worked closely on the creation of all the interactions of the minecart, as well as making them multiplayer synced for all interactions with items. As well as the majority of gameplay mechanics such as track splits, gun interactions, combat, and lanterns!

### Features

- Photon API
- VR
