<b>Snake Ideas</b>  <!--more-->

>My initial idea was to have a highscore focused system, based around adding modifiers to the original game to adjust your highscore, making the game easier or harder.
>My other ideas focused mainly on enhancing the experience of Snake, by focusing on line of sight the user would need to remember where the longer their snake gets the harder it would be to remember, making the game more about memory and planning.
