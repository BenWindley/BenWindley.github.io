### Responsibilities
After my previous grass shader I wanted to remake it for a while with a few features that I was lacking the technical ability to implement, and with the added challenge of implementing it in HDRP hlsl, it was a fun project!

### Features

- GPU instancing
- LOD visibility
- Render texture pass interactions
- Bendy grass
- Wind
- Geometry shader procedural meshes
