### Concept
In this project I wanted to explore the possibility of applying simulation techniques in vegetation generation over to the creation of models for games.

The main focusses of vegetation that I wanted to include was the interesting adaptation of plants to their environment and the structure of plants that could be made.

To port the simulation for the purpose of use in games I added level of detail to the meshes, reducing the number of triangles with decreased cylinder points in the branches and culling of smaller branches.

### Features

- DirectX 11
- Simulation
- Generation
