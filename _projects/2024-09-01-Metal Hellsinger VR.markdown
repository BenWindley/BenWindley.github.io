### Responsibilities
At Lab42 I worked on the port of the heavy metal rhythm shooter, Metal: Hellsinger, to VR platforms, throughout it's development I worked on various gameplay systems to translate the PC experience to VR.

One of these systems were the weapons, with certain difficulties arising due to it being a rhythm game, especially with the boomerang, bow, and sword, which needed multiple iterations to be satisfying, and in turn became completely unique implementations to their original ones. 

Accessibility features were also a big focus, such that many systems had to be versatile in functionality, or in displaying information in multiple ways.

### Features
