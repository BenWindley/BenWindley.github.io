### Initial Concept
The task given was to create a game in unreal with a focus on level design concepts. In this project I focused on getting acquainted with Unreal, as the blueprint interface would be a novel method of visualualising code.

The implementation had to include 3 metroidvania-stlye powerups to expand the range of exploration, as well as a motivational factor to push the player towards completing the level. 

### Iteration
The powerups were diversified so that it added variety to the gameplay, with the first powerup being an explosive bomb with the ability to push light objects and destroy objects that share the same material, this gave an opportunity to experiment with the destruction meshes, as well as particle effects. The second powerup was a good opportunity to attempt some shader-work, so I made a black hole style projectile with a particle effect as well as refractive distortion. The third and final powerup helped add variety on movement, with a malfunctioning jetpack that can only provide a explosive burst of force until the player returns to the ground.


### Gameplay
The gameplay centered mainly on third-person controls through the use of a camera boom to prevent the camera from clipping whilst the player traverses the interior of the spaceship.
