            <h4>About Me</h4>
			<p>I've been working in games since 2019, and I've had an interest in them ever since I got a GameBoy with Pokemon Yellow for Christmas.</p>
            <p>Although I work as a programmer professionally, I'm a generalist at heart, so when I'm not working I'm learning all the facets of game development on my own projects (mostly pretty shaders, prototypes, and system explorations)!</p>
			<p>I believe the benefits of having a variety of knowledge of other disciplines are that it helps me create systems that can hook into the code easier, and are more user friendly for other members of the team that work with them.</p>
