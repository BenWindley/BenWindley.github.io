### Summary
SPELLSCRIBE is a typing RPG prototype I made in my spare time, with a focus on learning any areas of game development I hadn't had a chance at yet.

My favourite parts of it are the unique game mechanic of immersive typing for spells and game interactions, and the fun biproduct of the gameplay motivating you to touch type.

An interesting shader I made for this game is the lighting for the grass, by using a texture as a lighting layer, I hand-pixelled a grass texture that contained the offset of the pixel from the base of the grass blade, and from that I could light the individual blades of grass. 

I also worked on using Yarnspinner as the implementation of narrative, and I was really impressed with the versatility of the tool, being an excelent bridge between engine, gameplay, and story.
