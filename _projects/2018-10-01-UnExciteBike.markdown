### Initial Concept

We were tasked to "demake" a popular modern game into a game that would suit an Atari generation game. We chose to demake Trials visually, of which in the team I worked on personally. 

### Implementation
I added several effects into the project:

- Pixelisation
- CRT Effect
- Grain
- Vignette

These were achieved through the use of post-processing shaders that I made for the camera.
