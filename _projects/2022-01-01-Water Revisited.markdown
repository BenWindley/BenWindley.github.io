### Responsibilities
After my first exploration in water shaders I wanted to learn shader graph, and I took that opportunity to improve my previous attempt at a water shader.

The implementation of my first attempt can be found here: https://benwindley.github.io/projects/WaterSimulation/

In this exploration I also used stencils to keep the boat empty of water, and some additional compute shaders to optimise the boyancy checkers.

### Features

- Unity
- Shaders
- URP
