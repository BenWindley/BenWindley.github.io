### Initial Concept

The task was to create a mechanical orrery and an automaton. I chose high contrasting colours to add focus onto the centerpiece - the orrery, to make it an even greater focal point I turned the sun into a radient lightbulb. I used the contrast of gold and obsidian along with the theming of a greek planetarium to draw attention towards the center of the room. 

### Skills used

The required skills to model the orrery were:

- Familiarity with Maya 2016
- Manipulation of faces
- Use of beveling on edges and faces
- Amending faces
- Animation
- Applying materials with normal maps and textures
- Creating multiple material types (Phong, Lambert, Blinn) and their relevant uses
