### Concept
This game used the Oculus Quest to feature multiplayer co-op gameplay in a wild-west themed minecart action-puzzle adventure game!

In this game I worked closely on the creation of all the interactions of the minecart, as well as making them multiplayer synced for all interactions with items.

### Features

- Photon API
- VR
