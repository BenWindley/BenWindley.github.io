### Concept

In this project I used a deep convolutional GAN to produce abstract artwork, my favourite features of this neural network is how it can recreate interesting borders, as well as palettes that match the colour theory used by professional artists.

I used Tensorflow and Python to accomplish this, along with a vast database of diverse art pieces.

I believe the project could have been more successful if the database was less diverse and instead focused on specific eras of art. 

The deep convolutional structure was chosen due to it's simplicity and ease of creating more fundamental based generations.
