### Initial Concept
The task given was to create a DirectX 11 procedural generator that creates buildings.


### Iteration
The first task required setting up a DirectX 11 project, which was quite difficult as the use of the DX Toolkit wasn't allowed, however it gave interesting insights into learning more about game engine pipelines.
The second task defined the architecture of the procedural generation, I focused on allowing the user to create interesting building shapes. This then had the features of building styles, interiors, and model importing added after.
The third task specified the purpose of the generator, for the exporting of these models as OBJ files to be used in game engines on modelling software. I later expanded this into OBJ importing as well to allow for the use of OBJ models in the procedural generation, preventing the majority of hard-coded prefabs from having to exist in the project.
