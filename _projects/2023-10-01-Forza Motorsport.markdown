### Responsibilities
At Lab42 I worked on adding PC support alongside console development by Turn 10.

I helped redesign their previous racing input system to integrate more peripherals.

I implemented TTS as an accesibility setting to read text prompts to the player.

I incorporated Discord and Steam rich presence to show what the player was currently doing in the game.

I created a system to estimate system capabilities to select recommended graphics options.

### Features
- Proprietary Engine
- Steam
- Accessibility
