### Initial Concept

Being presented with the theme "Endless Runner" there were many ways to iterate on, and many sub-genres to explore.
The main genres I explored were:
- Bullet Hells
- Rhythm Games

### Iteration

In a method to combine the flow of rhythm games and the intense visual dextarity required for bullet hells, I iterated via making a path that a spaceship must follow. To make sure the path has a sense of flow I had to make sure it was procedurally generated.

### Gameplay

The game allows input of player name, and stores the name and score achieved in a file which provides a competitive element to the game as well as replayability due to its challenging nature. The sine waves of hazards give the gameplay an interesting element visually as well as being fun to navigate through.
